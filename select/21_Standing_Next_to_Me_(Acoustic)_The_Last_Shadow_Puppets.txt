You want to have her
Two years have gone now
But I can't relate
To the never ending
Games that you play
As desire passes through
And you're open
To the truth
I hope you understand

[Chorus]
And your love
Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me

The one you fell for
Makes it seem juvenile
And you laugh
At yourself
Again and again
But as you drink
To the thoughts
She'll remember you
Maybe tomorrow

[Chorus: x2]

Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me

You want to have her
Two years have gone now
But I can't relate
To the never ending
Games that you play
As desire passes through
Then you're open
To the truth
I hope you understand

[Chorus]

Is standing next to me
Is standing next to me
