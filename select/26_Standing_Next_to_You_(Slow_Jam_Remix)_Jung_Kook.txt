Standing next to you
Play me slow
I push up on this funk and give me miracles
(Let ya body know)
Make it known
How we left and right is somethin' we control
(You already know)
You know that all night long we rock to this
Screamin', I testify this lovin'
All night long, we flock to this
Screamin', I testify that
We'll survive the test of time
They can't deny our love
They can't divide us
We'll survive the test of time
I promise I'll be right here
Standing next to you
Standing in the fire next to you, oh
You know it's deeper than the rain
It's deeper than the pain
When it's deep like DNA
Somethin' they can't take away, ayy
Take-take-take-take-take-take off
Standing next to you
Standing next to you (you)
Standing next to you
(Ta-ra, ra-da-da-ra)
Afterglow
Leave ya body golden like the sun and the moon
(You already know)
You know that all night long we rock to this (oh)
Screamin', I testify this lovin'
All night long, we flock to this (all night long)
Screamin', I testify that
We'll survive the test of time
They can't deny our love
They can't divide us
We'll survive the test of time
I swear that I'll be right here
Standing next to you (next to you)
Standing in the fire next to you (next to you), oh
You know it's deeper than the rain
It's deeper than the pain
When it's deep like DNA
Somethin' they can't take away, ayy
Take-take-take-take-take-take off
Standing next to you (standing next to you)
Standing next to you (standing next to you, standing next to you)
Standing next to you, oh (standing next to you, standing next to you)
Hey
(Standing next to you, standing next to you) standing next to you
(Standing next to you) bass and drums
Hoo
Ooh
Standing next to you
Standing next to you
Standing next to you
